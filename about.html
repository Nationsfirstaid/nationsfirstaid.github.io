      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are certified Red Cross instructors dedicated to delivering impactful and culturally aware first aid and CPR training. With a focus on hands-on learning, visual storytelling, and lived experience, we make training relatable and effective for all communities.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Safety is medicine. Culture is connection. Education is empowerment.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>Our backgrounds span trades, urban life, traditional practices, and life coaching. These perspectives help us adapt our teaching to connect with students from all walks of life—making every session meaningful and empowering.</p>

      <p>At Nations First Aid, we believe in recovery, growth, and gratitude. We embed these values into our instruction so that each participant leaves with knowledge, confidence, and renewed purpose.</p>
