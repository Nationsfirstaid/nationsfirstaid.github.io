        We are a team of certified instructors dedicated to delivering impactful and culturally aware Red Cross first aid and CPR training. With a focus on hands-on learning, personal growth, and community empowerment, our approach blends visual storytelling, lived experience, and accessible teaching.

      <blockquote>
        “Safety is medicine. Culture is connection. Education is empowerment.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Our instructors come from diverse backgrounds including trades, urban life, cultural practices, and life coaching. These experiences help us connect with students from all walks of life and tailor each session to be as meaningful as it is practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the power of recovery, growth, and gratitude—values that are interwoven into every training. Our vision is rooted in a decade of freedom, personal development, and a commitment to helping others learn the skills that save lives.
      </p>
